As a student, it can be challenging to keep track of your grades, progress and understanding of your overall academic performance. That's why I am excited to announce that I have recently created a CGPA Calculator using HTML and CSS. This tool is designed to make it easy for you to understand your current academic status and track your progress towards your goal.

The CGPA Calculator not only calculates your current average percentage based on your current CGPA, but also allows you to input a goal percentage and helps you to track your progress throughout your academic journey. With this tool, you can easily understand where you stand and what you need to do to reach your desired CGPA.

In addition, the user-friendly interface makes it easy to use and understand the results, allowing you to focus on your studies and achieving your goals.

In the rules section, you can find the information on how to use this calculator, including the input format and the rules that need to be followed while using it. It ensures that the results are accurate and reliable.

I believe that this tool will be beneficial for all students, regardless of their field of study or academic level. As a student myself, I understand the importance of managing grades and tracking progress, and I hope that this tool will make it easier for you to do so.

I would love to hear your feedback and thoughts on my CGPA Calculator. Give it a try and let me know what you think. I hope it will be a useful tool for you in your academic journey. #cgpa #calculator #html #css #studentlife"
